This is a Front-End Real Estate Web Application made using ReactJS and Material UI. It has four levels of filtering and shows results that satisfy the filter values for user convinience. It has a very friendly user interface. This website is a work in progress. Currently it shows dummy data stored locally. Real data will be added after building a database and integrating REST APIs. There are many amazing features that are yet to be added.
